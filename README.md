# Azure DevOps self host agent with maven github pipeline

Azure DevOps is a powerful platform for managing and deploying software projects, and it offers a wide range of tools and services to help developers and teams work more efficiently. One of the most useful features of Azure DevOps is the ability to use self-hosted agents to build, test, and deploy code. This allows teams to have full control over their build environment, and to run builds on machines that are dedicated to the task, rather than relying on shared resources.

One of the most common use cases for self-hosted agents is building Java projects that use the Maven build tool. Maven is a popular open-source tool that is widely used in the Java community, and it provides a powerful and flexible way to manage dependencies, build projects, and run tests.

When using self-hosted agents with Azure DevOps, teams can configure their agents to use specific versions of Java and Maven, which ensures that builds are consistent across different environments. Additionally, teams can configure their agents to use specific environments, such as a specific operating system or a specific version of a database, which ensures that builds are stable and reliable.

With Azure DevOps, teams can also configure their agents to use different build steps, such as running unit tests, deploying code to a staging environment, or deploying code to a production environment. This allows teams to have full control over their build pipeline, and to automate the entire process of building, testing, and deploying code.

Overall, Azure DevOps with self-hosted agents is a powerful and flexible way to manage software projects, and it provides teams with a wide range of tools and services to help them work more efficiently and effectively. Whether you're working on a small project or a large enterprise application, Azure DevOps with self-hosted agents is an excellent choice for managing your software development process.
